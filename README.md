## Purpose
This repository is based on a tutorial by Ray Wenderlich: [UITableView Tutorial: Dynamic Table View Cell Height](http://www.raywenderlich.com/87975/dynamic-table-view-cell-height-ios-8-swift).  The purpose is to use UI Builder (and the estimatedRowHeight property or delegate method) to create Cells that will dynamically size based on their content.  While this might not be a very complicated example of what you might encounter, it's easy to follow along and understand what you need to know to replicate it on your own.

## Stack
Or at least what I was using when I created this repo:
* XCode 7.2
* Swift 2.0
* iOS 9.2
